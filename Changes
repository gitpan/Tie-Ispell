Revision history for Tie-Ispell

0.05    2010, 10 November (18:46)
        - support to detect ispell, aspell or hunspell
        - skip tests if no english dictionary available
        - changed from ExtUtils::MakeMaker to Module::Build
        - Probably I will just stop maintaining this module as nobody
          uses it (as far as I know). So, if you are interested in it
          (if you use it or want to maintain it) let me know.

	- Added support to choose if you want to use nearmisses
	- Added test and code to support unkown dictionaries

0.03    2005, 23 January (19:50)
	- Added support for nearmisses
	- Changed test so we can work with aspell emulation mode
	for ispell. Note that this way the morphological information
	get lost (for example, $dic{dogs} will be "dogs" instead of
	the ispell answer "dog");

	- Added support for store: $dic{word} = "now exists";

0.01    2004, 17 December (11:57)
